Lane Detection System

Project Overview

This project implements a Lane Detection System designed to identify and track lane lines on roads using computer vision techniques. It processes images or video streams from a vehicle's camera to detect lane boundaries in real-time, enabling applications in autonomous driving, driver assistance systems, and road safety.

Features
1. Lane Line Detection: Identifies left and right lane lines using edge detection and Hough Transform.
2. Real-Time Processing: Optimized for processing video frames with minimal latency.
3. Robustness: Handles varying lighting conditions, road textures, and curved lanes.
4. Visualization: Overlays detected lane lines on the input video/image for clear visualization.
5. Modular Design: Easy-to-extend codebase for integrating with other autonomous driving modules.

Technologies Used
1. Python: Core programming language.
2. OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
3. NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
4. Matplotlib: For visualization and debugging.

How It Works
1. Preprocessing: Converts input images to grayscale and applies Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
2. Edge Detection: Uses Canny edge detection to identify lane line edges.
3. Region of Interest: Masks the image to focus on the road area.
4. Hough Transform: Detects straight lines corresponding to lane boundaries.
5. Lane Line Fitting: Fits polynomials to detected lines for smooth lane tracking.
6. Visualization: Overlays the detected lanes on the original image/video.
